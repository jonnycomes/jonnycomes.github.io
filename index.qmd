My name is Jonny. I'm an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at [The College of Idaho](https://www.collegeofidaho.edu/). 

I obtained my Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Oregon in 2010 under the supervision of [Victor Ostrik](https://pages.uoregon.edu/vostrik/). Prior to that I got my B.A. and M.A., both in mathematics, at the University of Montana. If you'd like to know more about my professional background, take a look at my [cv](/cv).

On this site I keep lists of my publications, 
my students' projects, and any resources I have written for student research projects.
There is also a technical blog where I (rarely) write about various math and cs stuff I'm thinking about.
